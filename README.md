# combating-anti-forensics-of-JPEG-compression
a forensic method for identifying whether an image was previously compressed by JPEG. Though some methods have already been proposed for this purpose, Stamm and Liuâ€™s anti-forensic method disables the detection capabilities of these methods. After analyzing the anti-forensics method, we propose to use the decimal histogr am of the coefficients to distinguish the never-compressed images from the previously compressed; even the compressed image is anti-forensically processed
this is implemented in image processing matlab tool
